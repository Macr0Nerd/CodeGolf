## What is this repo?
This repo is a collection of the code golf games that I played with a group of buddies. You can see the current week's prompt and code in the `testing_code` branch. Previous prompts can be found in the main branch, with the file name as the week that it's for. The prompt will be in the comments.

## Why did I update this file?
I needed a contribution for the day.
